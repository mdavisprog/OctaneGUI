    ECHO ninja          Use the ninja build system instead of the default (msbuild^). The path
    ECHO                to the ninja build system must be added to the PATH environment variable.
    ECHO clean          Cleans the intermediate files before generating and building. This forces
    ECHO                a full rebuild of the project.
    ECHO noapps         Only compiles the library.
    ECHO sfml           Builds the apps using the SFML library. The SFML_DIR variable must be set
    ECHO                for the generator to locate the library.
    ECHO sdl2           Builds the app using the SDL library. The SDL2 cmake and library paths must
    ECHO                be locatable by the generator through either the environment variables or the 
    ECHO                SDL2_DIR and SDL2_MODULE_PATH variables.
